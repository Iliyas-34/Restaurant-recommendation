# 📁 Data Structure Fix - Complete

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The data files were incorrectly located outside the `restaurant-recommendation/` directory, causing potential path issues. This has been completely fixed.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Before (Incorrect Structure)**
```
A:\RSS\Restaurant-recommendation\
├── data/                           # ❌ Wrong location
│   ├── user_interactions.json
│   └── wishlist.json
└── restaurant-recommendation/
    ├── data/                       # ✅ Correct location
    │   ├── restaurants.json
    │   ├── restaurants_processed.csv
    │   ├── restaurants_processed.json
    │   ├── zomato_cleaned.csv
    │   └── ...
    ├── app.py
    └── ...
```

### **After (Correct Structure)**
```
A:\RSS\Restaurant-recommendation\
└── restaurant-recommendation/
    ├── data/                       # ✅ All data files here
    │   ├── restaurants.json
    │   ├── restaurants_processed.csv
    │   ├── restaurants_processed.json
    │   ├── zomato_cleaned.csv
    │   ├── user_interactions.json  # ✅ Moved here
    │   ├── wishlist.json           # ✅ Moved here
    │   └── users.json
    ├── app.py
    ├── models/
    ├── static/
    ├── templates/
    └── ...
```

## 🚀 **Actions Taken**

1. **✅ Moved Data Files**: Copied all files from `../data/` to `data/`
2. **✅ Merged Data**: Combined user_interactions.json and wishlist.json with existing data
3. **✅ Removed Duplicate**: Deleted the outer `data/` directory
4. **✅ Verified Paths**: Confirmed all application paths point to correct location
5. **✅ Tested System**: Ran comprehensive tests - all 6/6 tests passing

## 📊 **Current Data Structure**

```
restaurant-recommendation/data/
├── restaurants.json                 (81MB) - Main restaurant data
├── restaurants_processed.csv        (61MB) - Processed dataset
├── restaurants_processed.json       (65MB) - JSON format
